(roster.forEach -> count up each role)
offenseFilled = 
tankFilled =

// If one is not filled, (>0) then go the preference list
console.table(_.differenceWith(players, selected, _.isEqual))
go through preference list and do a diff between it and selected - so the preference list is good to go?
go through players and do a diff between it and selected

first hit becomes the player.  

Save the player to that players draftPicks
update the active player.
