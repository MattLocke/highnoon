          h1.text-border What is Overwatch?

          p In May 2016, Blizzard released one of its most anticipated projects of the decade. At launch, Overwatch pulled a remarkable 7 million users within the first week of its public marketing. Only a mere two years into its life, and Overwatch is now continuing its exponential growthwith over 40 million players, an extensive merchandise list, unfathomable community following, and even a public gaming league with 12 teams and bountiful amounts of investor funding to back it. Even with such a huge following in the gaming community, Blizzard and Overwatch are both making national headlines and attracting the eyes of those who have not heard of the game before at all. But there are still countless amounts of people who are interested in all of the conversation, and are asking, “What is Overwatch?”

          p As an appreciation for both Overwatch and the Overwatch community, we are giving away some amazing custom Overwatch merchandise! All you have to do is make a short video explaining “What is Overwatch?”, going over the most important premises that would allow someone who has never heard of the game understand what Overwatch is. There are a couple rules that we will supply down below, but we want all of our submitters to be clear, concise, and to have fun with their content. As long as you touch on the basic points below, you are free to add any other extra information or insight!
